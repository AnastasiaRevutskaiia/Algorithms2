 - **WordNet.java** - is a semantic lexicon for the English language that is used extensively by computational linguists and cognitive scientists; for example, it was a key component in IBM's [Watson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)). WordNet groups words into sets of synonyms called *synsets* and describes semantic relationships between them. One such relationship is the *is-a* relationship, which connects a *hyponym* (more specific synset) to a *hypernym* (more general synset). For example, *animal* is a hypernym of both *bird* and *fish*; *bird* is a hypernym of *eagle*, *pigeon*, and *seagull*.
 
Requires the stdlib.jar and algs4.jar to run, available in Maven repository. See given **build.gradle** file.
